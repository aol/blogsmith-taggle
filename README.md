====================

*"A simple plugin for complicated times."*

"Taggle": a portmanteau of "tagger" and "toggle". Adds handy buttons for commonly used or important tags. Easily customizable by owners/editors for particular sites.

Lots of our blogs have a handful of particularly common or important tags that editors use over and over again. Sometimes, they're system tags prefixed with an @ symbol. Taggle lets you set up a handful of easy tags that get displayed as buttons above the tags input, saving your editors time and frustration.

Activation
----------

In the Blogsmith CMS, go to `Management » Plugins`, search for "Taggle", then click "enable".

Setup
-----

Someone with Editor or Owner privileges will need to set up the first tags. To do so, go to any page that has the tags box in the sidebar (ie, create a new post or edit an existing one).

Owners and Editors should see a gear in the upper right-hand corner of the *Tags* box in the right rail. Click on it.

Since you have no easy tags set up, click the green plus icon to add your first tag.

You can enter any commonly used or important tag for your site. Click okay, and your new easy tag should appear in a list above the tag input.

Right now, you're in editing mode. That means you can:

* *add more tags* (click the green plus icon),
* *delete tags* (click the x on the right of the easy tag itself), or
* *re-order them* (click + hold the drag handle icon to the left of the easy tag and drag it above or below other tags).

To exit editing mode, just click the gear icon again.

Use
---

To use the easy tags, just click on one. It will turn a different color and the tag will be added to your post or page. To remove it, just click on the tag again.
